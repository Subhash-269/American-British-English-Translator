# American British English Translator

Translates between American English and British English:
  1. Converts between alternative spellings ("cozy"/"cosy")
  2. Identifies words that have different meanings in each of the two dialects ("pants", "rubber")
  3. Identifies words that are typically used in only one of the dialects ("ladybug"/"ladybird")

I wrote this script because existing programs I found only performed the first function.
